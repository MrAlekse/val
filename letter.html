          unfortunately. I just want to let you know that you will always have a special place in my heart even, if your not my girl 
          anymore. I made this little effort to show you how much I appriaciate you and the time we spent together. Even though my effort is to late
          I still want to say sorry for the things I did wrong and the things I couldn’t give you when we were together. I hope that you find happiness
          in your life even if my presence is no longer in your life. I want to thank you for the memories, the love, the care and the lessons you taught me.
          Your more than just a girlfriend you were also a mother that teach me the right things. I hope that you can forgive me for the things I did.
          "Always do better and when you know better, then do better" I hope that you achieve all your dreams and goals in life. I will always be here to support you from afar.
          I wish you all the best in life and love. Happy Valentine’s day my dear Mik
